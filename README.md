# predstock Frontend

This is the React frontend that goes with the [predstock API backend](https://github.com/ricardo-tavares-santos/predstock-api). 

It uses Bootstrap styles and reactstrap, which creates Bootstrap components, to create a responsive data table that displays all data from a table in a database. It has a modal form for adding and editing items, a delete and edit button in each item row, and a button to download the entire database table into a CSV file.

It uses react-csv to create the CSV download button.
